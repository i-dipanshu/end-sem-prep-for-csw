Email audience segmentation is key to a successful [email marketing campaign](https://www.smartlead.ai/blog/email-campaign-manager). By dividing your subscribers into small groups based on shared traits, demographics, or behaviors, you can ensure that your email content is highly targeted and personalized. It will help you nurture and convert leads into customers.
Let's consider that Emma, a growing entrepreneur, has created an app for small business owners, but the audience she sent marketing messages to through email marketing was not business owners.
The second thing that happened to her was they gave terrible reviews for the app. But, again, this was because people didn't understand what the app was for, and her app got bad ratings on both the Play Store and the Apple Store.
Her biggest mistake was not understanding audience segmentation's power when performing an email advertising campaign. She was unaware of email engagement behavior. When marketers fail to segment their audience or meet their potential customers, the worst possible outcome is that audiences will disengage, and marketing ROI will suffer.
On the other hand, segmenting your audience can increase your engagement levels by 3X times.
Many businesses' development campaigns through email fail because they don't segment their email list. Many direct-mail advertising platforms help you segment, and one of the best is Smartlead.ai. It sends personalized messages to the segmented audience.
In this blog post, we'll share email segmentation strategies you can start using on your email list.

## Before moving ahead, you first need to understand what audience segmentation is.

A marketing strategy involves identifying smaller groups within the target audience and delivering more personalized messages to them. This creates stronger connections with your **email marketing list.**
**Email marketing metrics** depend upon these subgroups and can be based on factors such as geographical location, gender, age, ethnicity, income, or level of education. Alternatively, they can also be based on past behavior, such as purchase history.
Psychographics segment audiences based on personality, values, attitudes, and beliefs. For example, you might create separate segments for family-oriented people versus individualistic or for those who are leaders versus followers.


## Why should one be doing email segmentation for a successful marketing campaign?

You serve different people, and your buyer persona is a guide, but not everyone on your **email list** will be a perfect match.
For example, you run a content writing business for tech startup founders, but you also have marketers, small business owners, and freelance writers on your email list. To keep these people engaged, you must ensure the content you share caters to their specific wants and needs.
The [buyer's journey](https://www.yokellocal.com/blog/what-is-the-buyers-journey) is not linear, but your **sales funnel** is. A study by SiriusDecisions showed that buyers could complete up to 70% of the journey before even reaching out to you. It would be best to meet your leads where they are in your sales funnel to get them to progress further. 
Tailoring your emails to the interests of your email list subscribers will result in more opened emails and clicks on your offers. It can increase your email open rates by up to 203% and your revenue by 760%. Segmented emails always work better than normal ones as they are specific.
